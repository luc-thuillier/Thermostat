This Arduino project creates a thermostat system using a potentiometer, LEDs (or an RGB light), a temperature sensor, and an LCD display. The system greets the user with a welcome message on the LCD and displays the ambient temperature in degrees Fahrenheit on the first line, with the set temperature (controlled by the potentiometer) on the second line. The LCD refreshes every second or less. When the temperature is below the set point, a red LED turns on, and the display shows “Heater ON!” on the first line. If the temperature is above the set point, a blue LED turns on, and “AC ON!” is displayed. Both LEDs remain off when the temperature is within ±1°F of the set point.
